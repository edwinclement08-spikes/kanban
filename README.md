# Quick Kanban

A simple todo app with a twist, every action can be performed within 3
keystrokes. Being a Vim-lover, I have come to appreciate the ease of using only
the keyboard.

This is also inspired by Spacemacs/Doom Emacs. If there's one thing that I dreaded
when I started using Vim was remembering the key that triggered X functionality.
This is where Spacemacs completely blew my mind. The suggestion system that
spacemacs uses is very useful to quickly learn the shortcuts.

Using the suggestion system of spacemacs and the on-mouse philosophy of Vim, let
me present to you, quick-kanban.
